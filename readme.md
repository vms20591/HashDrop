# HashDrop

Verify the integrity of a file that you received or downloaded from the available hash. In the current version of the app you could, 

* Verify one file at a time (browse file from the system)
* The hash can either be loaded from a file (should contain only the hash) or can be directly pasted

## Planned Features

* Drag and Drop of the File & Hash
* Verify multiple files
* Download and verify files from an external source

## Dev

```
$ npm install
```

### Run

```
$ npm start
```

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
